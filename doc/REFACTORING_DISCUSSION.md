### Refactoring Plan

* What are the code's biggest issues?

The code's biggest issues are improving the design of the major classes which are Logo.java and
LogoDisplay.java. Both of these files are relatively convoluted as highlighted by the online
utility, because they are the primary programs that execute the program. The major issues are that
there is flawed exception handling, extensive use of magic numbers (including in LogoDisplay.java
where CSS should be used) and extracting methods/classes are necessary to improve the layout and
readability of the code.

* Which issues are easy to fix and which are hard?

The easiest issue to fix are long methods, since they can easily be broken up into sub-methods that
accomplish a single task. The hardest issues to fix

* What are good ways to implement the changes "in place"?
